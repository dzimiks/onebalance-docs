## Features

Our API provides powerful capabilities to streamline your blockchain operations:

- **Smart Account Management**: Predict addresses and enable auto-deployment
- **Cross-Chain Balances**: View aggregated balances including resource locks
- **Multi-Chain Transactions**: Execute transfers and swaps using aggregated balances

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using an API key passed in the `x-api-key` header:

```bash Send your first request
curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://be.onebalance.io/api/assets/list' \
  -H 'x-api-key: ${ONEBALANCE_API_KEY}'
```

<Note>
  A public API key is available for testing purposes with limited usage:
  `42bb629272001ee1163ca0dbbbc07bcbb0ef57a57baf16c4b1d4672db4562c11`
